# Development History & Agent Instructions

## üéØ Current Task

*   [ ] **1. Create a Test for `useTimeline` Hook**: In a new test file, `app/hooks/useTimeline.test.tsx`, write a test case to verify the scroll-spy functionality. The test will render a component using the `useTimeline` hook, simulate a scroll event, and assert that the `activeSection` state is correctly updated.
*   [ ] **2. Run Initial Test**: Execute the test suite to confirm that the new test fails with the current implementation, as expected.
*   [ ] **3. Memoize `timelineSections`**: In `app/hooks/useTimeline.ts`, import `useMemo` from React and wrap the `getTimelineSections(timelineData)` call in `useMemo`. This will stabilize the `timelineSections` variable.
*   [ ] **4. Update `useLayoutEffect` Dependencies**: Adjust the dependency array of the scroll-handling `useLayoutEffect` in `app/hooks/useTimeline.ts` to depend on the newly memoized `timelineSections`.
*   [ ] **5. Re-run Tests**: Run the test suite again to confirm that the fix has resolved the issue and the test now passes.
*   [ ] **6. Manual Verification**: Perform a final manual check of the application to ensure the timeline's sidebar navigation and progress indicator work as expected during scrolling.

## üìã Agent Guidelines

### **For Future Development**
1. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Use established service/repository/API patterns
2. **Security First**: Always use service role + explicit user authorization in API routes
3. **Modular Architecture**: Keep features independent when possible
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add tests for new functionality
5. **Update Documentation**: Keep README.md current with new features

### **Safe Development Areas** (Independent Modification)
- Timeline generation features
- AI Opportunities analysis
- New AI service integrations
- UI/UX improvements
- New business intelligence features

### **Requires Coordination** (Shared Infrastructure)
- `aiService.ts` modifications
- Database schema changes
- Authentication patterns
- Core repository methods

### **Standard Patterns**
```typescript
// API Route Pattern
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);

// AI Service Usage
const result = await aiService.generateJson(
  systemPrompt,
  userPrompt,
  userId,
  CredentialsRepository,
  preferredProvider
);
```
