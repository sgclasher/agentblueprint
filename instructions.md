### Core Test Suite (Quick & Practical)
1. **ServiceNow Flow Visualization**
   - Can connect to ServiceNow instance
   - Can fetch and display flow data 
   - Can expand/collapse nodes
   - Layout changes work (LR/TB)

2. **Client Profile Management**
   - Can create a new profile via wizard
   - Can save and retrieve profiles
   - Can load demo data
   - Markdown generation works

3. **AI Timeline Generation**
   - Can generate timeline from profile
   - Scenario switching works
   - Metrics update correctly
   - Floating widget displays

### Testing Approach
```bash
# Simple command to test everything
npm run test:smoke

# What this does:
# 1. Runs key feature tests
# 2. Shows pass/fail for each feature
# 3. Takes ~3 seconds total
# 4. Gives confidence before commits
```

### Implementation Plan
1. **Create `test:smoke` script** ✅ DONE
2. **Use existing Jest setup** ✅ DONE
3. **Mock external services** ✅ DONE

- Performance optimizations
- Browser compatibility
- Accessibility (until later)

### Quick Win: GitHub Actions ✅ DONE
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Features
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci

## 🌙 UI Consistency & Design System - Implementation Notes

### Current State (December 2024)
**PRIORITY**: UI consistency is now **Phase 5** - the next implementation phase after database migration completion.

**The Challenge**: The application has inconsistent UI across pages:
- ✅ **Timeline page**: Professional CSS variables system with working light/dark mode
- ❌ **Other pages**: Hardcoded dark theme colors and inconsistent styling

### Reference Implementation
The **timeline page** (`app/timeline/timeline.css`) already demonstrates the complete solution:
- CSS variables system (`:root` and `[data-timeline-theme="light"]`)
- Professional theme toggle component
- Responsive design with glass morphism effects

### Implementation Approach (Phase 5)
**Goal**: Extend timeline's CSS variables system to entire application

**Files Requiring Updates**:
1. **Global Styles**: `app/globals.css` - Main application styles
2. **ServiceNow Page**: Convert hardcoded colors to variables
3. **Profile Pages**: Standardize profile cards, forms, detail views  
4. **Authentication**: Convert auth forms to use design system
5. **Global Header**: Add theme toggle component

**Success Criteria**:
- All pages use consistent CSS variables system
- Global light/dark mode toggle works across entire app
- Professional appearance matching timeline page quality
- Theme persistence using localStorage

### Ready for Implementation
This is now **the next development priority** before AI integration. The timeline page provides the complete blueprint for implementation.
