**Quality Improvements Expected:**
- Business Specificity Score: 10/25 ‚Üí 20/25 (100% improvement)
- Agent titles: Generic "Process Analyst" ‚Üí Specific "Production Planning Coordinator"
- Workflows: High-level descriptions ‚Üí Detailed trigger ‚Üí flow ‚Üí outcome patterns
- Cross-Provider: Consistent quality across OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini

**üéØ READY FOR UI TESTING**: The enhanced prompt system is now live and ready for functionality testing through the AI Blueprint interface.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FEEDBACK INTEGRATION - January 2025**:
Based on UI testing feedback, added **MANDATORY BUSINESS PROCESS NARRATIVE** requirement to address lack of coherent workflow stories. Current blueprints lack clear beginning ‚Üí middle ‚Üí end process flows that demonstrate actual business process understanding.

**RECOMMENDED TESTING APPROACH:**
1. **Switch to o3 (Cost-Effective) or o3-pro** for better business process reasoning
2. **Test with Strategic Procurement Modernization** initiative
3. **Validate**: Generated blueprint should tell coherent procurement story (Request ‚Üí Research ‚Üí RFx ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Award)
4. **Look for**: Sequential agent cooperation, clear handoffs, domain expertise demonstration

**üîß CRITICAL FIXES - REAL API CALLS (January 2025)**:

**ALL THREE PROVIDERS WERE COMPLETELY FAKE** - Fixed to use actual API calls:

1. **OpenAI Provider Fixed**: `openaiServerProvider.ts`
   - **BEFORE**: Hardcoded list with fake 200ms delay pretending to be API call
   - **AFTER**: Real `/v1/models` API call filtering to chat completion models
   - **Includes**: Manual addition of o3/o3-pro models (not yet in OpenAI API response)

2. **Claude Provider Fixed**: `claudeServerProvider.ts`
   - **BEFORE**: Hardcoded list with fake 150ms delay pretending to be API call
   - **AFTER**: Real `/v1/models` API call to Anthropic with proper filtering
   - **Uses**: Environment `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for model fetching

3. **Google Provider Fixed**: `googleServerProvider.ts`
   - **BEFORE**: Hardcoded list with fake 100ms delay pretending to be API call
   - **AFTER**: Real `/v1beta/models` API call to Google with generateContent filtering
   - **Uses**: Environment `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for model fetching

**Impact**: The "Refresh Models" button in Admin interface now actually calls the real APIs instead of returning fake hardcoded lists. All providers include proper fallback handling if API calls fail.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Reference

### **Core Files & Architecture**

**Key Application Files**:
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main business profile interface with 6-tab business intelligence dashboard (Overview, Initiatives, AI Opportunities, Agent Blueprint, Systems, Contacts)
- `app/profiles/components/ProfileWizard.tsx` - 2-step onboarding wizard
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - AI provider credential management

**Business Logic**:
- `app/services/aiService.ts` - **CRITICAL** - Centralized AI provider abstraction
- `app/services/agenticBlueprintService.ts` - Agent Blueprint generation logic (5-agent digital teams)
- `app/services/aiOpportunitiesService.ts` - AI opportunity analysis
- `app/services/profileService.ts` - Profile data operations and timeline coordination

**Data Layer**:
- `app/repositories/profileRepository.ts` - Database operations with caching
- `app/services/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for core data structures
- `app/lib/llm/prompts/` - All prompt engineering templates

### **Architecture Patterns**

```typescript
// API Route Pattern
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);

// AI Service Usage
const result = await aiService.generateJson(
  systemPrompt,
  userPrompt,
  userId,
  CredentialsRepository,
  preferredProvider
);
```

### **Development Guidelines**
- **Modular Independence**: Features should be independently modifiable
- **Shared Infrastructure**: `aiService.ts`, `credentialsRepository.ts`, `profileRepository.ts`
- **Security First**: Service role + explicit user authorization in all API routes
- **Performance**: Use caching for expensive AI operations

### **Knowledge Base References**
- **KB_LLM_MODEL_UPDATES_2025.md** - Latest 2025 API changes and model capabilities
- **KB_AI_AGENT_HANDBOOK.md** - Agentic AI strategic implementation guide
- **KB_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_MVP.md** - MVP blueprint for agentic AI workflows

### **Critical Database Migration** (Agent Blueprint Support)

**BEFORE TESTING Agent Blueprints**, run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Add agentic_blueprint_cache column to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS agentic_blueprint_cache JSONB;

-- Add index for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_agentic_blueprint_cache 
ON profiles USING gin (agentic_blueprint_cache) 
WHERE agentic_blueprint_cache IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Platform Status**
- **Agent Blueprint System**: Production-ready with cross-provider support (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- **Business Profile Management**: 6-tab business intelligence interface with ROI data collection
- **AI Timeline**: Multi-scenario generation with permanent caching
- **AI Opportunities**: Strategic recommendations with readiness scoring
