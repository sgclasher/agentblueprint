## 📋 Development Guidelines

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Modular Independence**: Features should be independently modifiable
- **Shared Infrastructure**: `aiService.ts`, `credentialsRepository.ts`, `profileRepository.ts`
- **Security First**: Service role + explicit user authorization in all API routes
- **Performance**: Use caching for expensive AI operations

### **Standard Patterns**
```typescript
// API Route Pattern
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);

// AI Service Usage
const result = await aiService.generateJson(
  systemPrompt,
  userPrompt,
  userId,
  CredentialsRepository,
  preferredProvider
);
```

### **Key Files Reference**
- **Types**: `app/services/types.ts` - Core data structures
- **Profile UI**: `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main profile interface
- **AI Service**: `app/services/aiService.ts` - Centralized AI provider
- **Profile Wizard**: `app/profiles/components/ProfileWizard.tsx` - Onboarding
- **AI Prompts**: `app/lib/llm/prompts/` - Prompt engineering
