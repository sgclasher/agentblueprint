### **COMPLETED: Fix Profile Loading After Save** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** (June 2025)

**Issue**: Profile would save successfully but wouldn't load on page revisit, showing ProfileWizard instead of saved data.

**Root Cause**: API endpoint `/api/profiles/get` was calling `ProfileRepository` (client-side supabase with RLS) instead of using service role client directly.

**Solution**: Updated `/api/profiles/get` to use service role client directly, matching the save endpoint pattern.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - Profile save-load cycle now works perfectly.

---

## üéØ Previous Task: Fix Profile Loading After Save (Legacy)

### **Plan: Fix Profile Loading After Save**

- [x] **Step 1: Fix RLS Policies in Database** ‚úÖ
  - Files: Database schema (Supabase SQL)
  - Update RLS policies for the `profiles` table to allow proper read/write access
  - ‚úÖ All 4 RLS policies created successfully: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

- [x] **Step 2: Create Server-Side Profile Fetch API Route** ‚úÖ
  - Files: `app/api/profiles/get/route.ts` (new file)
  - Create a server-side API route for fetching profiles to bypass RLS issues consistently
  - ‚úÖ Created GET endpoint with service role authentication and comprehensive error handling

- [x] **Step 3: Update ProfileService to Use Server-Side API** ‚úÖ
  - Files: `app/services/profileService.ts`
  - Modify `getCurrentUserProfile()` to use the new server-side API route instead of direct Supabase calls
  - ‚úÖ Updated method to use `/api/profiles/get` with proper authentication and error handling

- [x] **Step 4: Enhance Error Handling in ProfileRepository** ‚úÖ
  - Files: `app/repositories/profileRepository.ts`
  - Add better error handling for 406 and other RLS-related errors
  - ‚úÖ Added specific error handling for RLS violations (42501, PGRST301) and row-level security messages

- [x] **Step 5: Update useAuthStore Profile Fetching** ‚úÖ
  - Files: `app/store/useAuthStore.ts`
  - Ensure proper error handling and retry logic for profile fetching
  - ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error handling and logging for profile fetch operations

- [x] **Step 6: Test Profile Save-Load Cycle** üö® **PARTIALLY FIXED - CORE ISSUE REMAINS**
  - Files: Manual testing
  - Verify the complete flow: save profile ‚Üí navigate away ‚Üí return ‚Üí see saved profile data
  - ‚úÖ **LOADING LOOP FIXED**: Infinite re-render loop in app/page.tsx useEffect dependency array resolved
  - ‚úÖ **PAGE LOADS**: App no longer stuck on loading spinner
  - üö® **CORE ISSUE PERSISTS**: Profile saves successfully but doesn't load on page revisit
  - üîç **CURRENT STATE**: ProfileService.getCurrentUserProfile() returns null (temporary bypass)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEXT STEPS**: Re-enable profile fetching and debug the /api/profiles/get endpoint

- [ ] **Step 7: Debug Profile Loading Issue** üéØ **PRIORITY FOR NEXT SESSION**
  - Files: `app/services/profileService.ts`, `app/api/profiles/get/route.ts`
  - **ISSUE**: Profile saves but doesn't load on page revisit
  - **CURRENT STATE**: ProfileService.getCurrentUserProfile() has temporary bypass returning null
  - **ACTION NEEDED**: 
    1. Remove temporary bypass in ProfileService.getCurrentUserProfile()
    2. Test /api/profiles/get endpoint directly (Postman/curl)
    3. Debug authentication flow in the API route
    4. Verify RLS policies are working correctly
    5. Add proper error handling and logging

**Issue:** After saving a profile successfully, when revisiting the profile page, it shows a blank form instead of saved profile details. 

**Current Status (End of Session):**
- ‚úÖ Profile saving works correctly via `/api/profiles/save`
- ‚úÖ RLS policies are properly configured (verified in Supabase)
- ‚úÖ Infinite loading loop fixed (app loads normally)
- üö® Profile loading fails - ProfileService.getCurrentUserProfile() has temporary bypass
- üîç Need to debug `/api/profiles/get` endpoint and authentication flow

---

## üéØ Previous Task: Single-Profile Architecture Transition

### Status: 95% Complete - One Issue Remaining ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### ‚úÖ Completed Phases

**Phase 1: Planning and Documentation** ‚úÖ
- [x] Analyzed existing multi-profile architecture
- [x] Created detailed implementation plan
- [x] Updated documentation

**Phase 2: Backend and Database Refactoring** ‚úÖ
- [x] **Database Schema**: Updated `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` and `app/database/schema.sql` 
  - Replaced `client_profiles` table with `profiles` table
  - Added UNIQUE constraint on `user_id` (one profile per user)
  - Updated RLS policies and indexes
- [x] **Repository Layer**: Completely refactored `app/repositories/profileRepository.ts`
  - Changed table references from `client_profiles` to `profiles`
  - Removed `getProfiles()` method
  - Renamed `getProfile()` to `getProfileByUserId(userId)`
  - Consolidated into single `saveProfile(userId, profileData)` upsert method
- [x] **Service Layer**: Refactored `app/services/profileService.ts`
  - Replaced `getProfiles()` with `getCurrentUserProfile()`
  - Merged create/update into `saveCurrentUserProfile()`
  - Updated timeline generation for single-profile model
- [x] **API Routes**: Updated key endpoints
  - `app/api/profiles/analyze-opportunities/route.ts`: Removed `profileId` dependency
  - `app/api/profiles/extract-markdown/route.ts`: Simplified to use user auth only
  - **NEW**: `app/api/profiles/save/route.ts`: Server-side profile saving

**Phase 3: State Management and UI Refactoring** ‚úÖ
- [x] **State Management**: 
  - Updated `useAuthStore.ts`: Added `profile: Profile | null`, fetch during initialization
  - Refactored `useBusinessProfileStore.ts`: Focused on timeline UI state only
- [x] **File Deletions**: Removed obsolete files
  - `app/profiles/page.tsx` (profile list view)
  - `app/profiles/[id]/page.tsx` (profile detail view)  
  - `app/timeline/components/ProfileSelector.tsx` (profile selector dropdown)
- [x] **Page Consolidation**: Major refactor of `app/profile/page.tsx`
  - Conditional rendering: ProfileWizard for new users, tabbed view for existing
  - Integrated editing capabilities for both account and profile data
- [x] **Component Updates**: 
  - Updated ProfileWizard for single-profile model
  - Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING ISSUE: Profile Save Functionality**

**Problem**: Row Level Security (RLS) policy preventing profile saves
- Error: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "profiles"`
- Affects: ProfileWizard "Save Profile" button functionality

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ Created server-side API route (`/api/profiles/save`) to bypass RLS
2. ‚úÖ Updated ProfileService to use server-side API instead of direct database access
3. ‚úÖ Fixed button text ("Create Profile" ‚Üí "Save Profile")
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS**: RLS policy verification and fix in Supabase

**Next Steps for Resolution**:
1. **Run RLS Policy Fix** in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Drop and recreate RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON profiles;

ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for users to their own profile" 
  ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert access for users to create their own profile" 
  ON profiles FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Enable update access for users to their own profile" 
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Enable delete access for users to their own profile" 
  ON profiles FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

2. **Test Profile Save**: Try saving profile again after RLS fix
3. **Verify Database**: Confirm profile data persists correctly

#### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] **Complete End-to-End Testing** after RLS fix
- [ ] **Verify Timeline Generation** works with single profile
- [ ] **Test Profile Editing** functionality

This file tracks major development milestones and serves as a quick reference for agents working on the Agentic AI Flow platform.
