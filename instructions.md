# Agent Blueprint - Task Management & Development Instructions

## üéØ **Current Tasks**

### **Outstanding Issues for Next Session:**

1. **Profile Detail Page Redesign** 
   - **Issue**: Profiles detail page still designed for old complex profile schema
   - **Need**: Redesign to display simplified MVP schema (7 fields) instead of complex nested fields
   - **Files**: Profile detail/view components need updating

2. **Fix Google Gemini Profile Generation**
   - **Issue**: Only GPT-4o confirmed working for profile extraction from markdown
   - **Need**: Debug and fix Gemini API integration for markdown import feature
   - **Context**: Gemini does very well with timeline generation, should work for profile extraction too

3. **Timeline Generation Bug After Markdown Import**
   - **Issue**: "Failed to generate timeline: Encryption utilities should only be used server-side" error
   - **Trigger**: Occurs when Generate Timeline is clicked on "Review & Complete" step after importing markdown
   - **Need**: Fix server-side encryption call in timeline generation flow

4. **AI Provider Performance Optimization**
   - **Observation**: Gemini excels at timeline generation while GPT-4o performs poorly  
   - **Need**: Optimize provider selection recommendations based on task type
   - **Opportunity**: Guide users to best provider for each use case

## üéØ **MVP Schema Simplification - COMPLETED**

**Problem Identified:** The data schema was too complex for an MVP, with 17+ nested field types causing:
- Overwhelming user experience (too many fields)
- Unreliable AI extraction (too many complex patterns)
- Development complexity (extensive validation/mapping)
- Poor data quality (users lack detailed information)

**Solution Implemented:** Simplified to 7 essential MVP fields:
‚úÖ `companyName` - Company identification
‚úÖ `industry` - Business sector 
‚úÖ `employeeCount` - Company size indicator
‚úÖ `annualRevenue` - Revenue qualification
‚úÖ `primaryLocation` - Geographic data
‚úÖ `websiteUrl` - Research validation
‚úÖ `strategicInitiatives` - Sales opportunity context

**Technical Changes Made:**
- **Simplified Types** (`app/services/types.ts`) - Reduced from 17+ interfaces to 2 core interfaces
- **Focused Prompts** (`app/lib/llm/prompts/profileExtraction.js`) - Clear, specific extraction instructions
- **Streamlined Validation** (`app/services/profileExtractionService.js`) - Targeted validation for essential fields
- **Updated Tests** (`app/__tests__/features/markdown-import.test.js`) - All 20 tests passing with simplified schema

**Benefits Achieved:**
- üöÄ **Faster Development** - Less complex validation and mapping logic
- üéØ **Better UX** - Users can easily provide essential information
- üìà **Higher Success Rate** - AI extraction more reliable with focused fields
- ‚úÖ **MVP Ready** - Core value proposition validated before adding complexity

**Archived for Future:** Complex enterprise fields (ValueSellingFramework, AIAssessment, etc.) can be added back based on user feedback and usage patterns.

## üéØ **Previous Tasks**

### **‚úÖ Completed: Fix Markdown Import Authentication Issues**

**Objective:** Resolve the authentication blocking issue preventing markdown import functionality.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Authentication issues resolved, basic extraction working.

**Current State:** 
- ‚úÖ Authentication working correctly with Authorization headers
- ‚úÖ Basic fields extracting (company name, industry, size, revenue, location, etc.)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Next Issue**: Complex fields (business problems, AI opportunities, strategic initiatives) not extracting despite being in markdown

#### Implementation Checklist:

**Phase 1: Fix Backend Authentication Pattern**
- [x] **Fix API route authentication** - Updated `/api/profiles/extract-markdown/route.ts` to use correct Supabase auth pattern `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies })`
- [x] **Convert to TypeScript** - Converted from `.js` to `.ts` with proper TypeScript interfaces
- [x] **Add proper error handling** - Added comprehensive error handling and authentication logging

**Phase 2: Fix Frontend Authentication Headers**
- [x] **Update ProfileWizard component** - Added Authorization header using `Bearer ${session.access_token}` pattern matching timeline components
- [x] **Add session validation** - Added session check before API call with user-friendly error message
- [x] **Improve error handling** - Added comprehensive logging and authentication error handling

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation**
- [x] **Write authentication tests** - Added 4 new authentication tests covering Authorization headers, 401 errors, session validation, and correct auth patterns
- [x] **Manual testing** - All 14 markdown import tests passing, including authentication flow validation
- [x] **Cross-reference working patterns** - Confirmed backend uses `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies })` pattern matching timeline routes

**Phase 4: Documentation Updates**
- [x] **Update troubleshooting guide** - Removed authentication error section from README.md troubleshooting
- [x] **Add usage instructions** - Added comprehensive markdown import usage guide and API documentation

**Key Files to Modify:**
- `app/api/profiles/extract-markdown/route.js` ‚Üí `route.ts` (backend auth fix)
- `app/profiles/components/ProfileWizard.tsx` (frontend auth headers)
- `app/__tests__/features/markdown-import.test.js` (add auth tests)
- `README.md` (remove troubleshooting section)
- `instructions.md` (update status)

**Root Cause Identified:**
- Backend uses incorrect `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies: () => cookieStore })` pattern
- Frontend missing Authorization headers in API call
- Should match working pattern: `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies })` + proper session handling

**Expected Outcome:**
The markdown import feature will work correctly with proper user authentication, matching the security pattern used by all other working features in the application.

#### **‚úÖ Completion Summary (December 2024):**

**Issues Resolved:**
- ‚ùå **Backend**: Incorrect `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies: () => cookieStore })` pattern causing session detection failure
- ‚ùå **Frontend**: Missing Authorization headers in API requests
- ‚ùå **Documentation**: Misleading troubleshooting guide indicating feature was broken

**Solutions Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Backend Authentication**: Updated `/api/profiles/extract-markdown/route.ts` to use correct `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies })` pattern matching timeline routes
- ‚úÖ **Added Frontend Auth Headers**: Updated ProfileWizard to include `Authorization: Bearer ${session.access_token}` headers
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive authentication logging and user-friendly error messages
- ‚úÖ **Added Authentication Tests**: 4 new tests covering Authorization headers, 401 errors, session validation, and auth patterns
- ‚úÖ **Updated Documentation**: Removed troubleshooting section, added usage guide and API documentation

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ All 14 markdown import tests passing
- ‚úÖ Authentication working with proper Authorization headers
- ‚úÖ Basic field extraction operational (company info, revenue, location, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Seamless integration with existing ProfileWizard and AI provider infrastructure
