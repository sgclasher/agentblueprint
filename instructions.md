## üéØ NEXT PRIORITY: MVP Simplification & Agentic Workflow Redesign

### **Implementation Plan: Keep It Simple, Add Clear Value**

**Objective**: Make minimal, high-impact improvements to the core flow while redesigning the agentic workflow feature to complete the Business ‚Üí Problems ‚Üí Value ‚Üí **Implementation** journey.

**Context**: Current 2-step profile creation is perfect. Focus on small additions that directly improve the AI recommendations, plus major redesign of workflow visualization.

#### **Phase 1: Minimal Essential Additions (Keep It Simple)**

##### **Step 1.1: Single Process Question**
- **Files**: `app/profiles/components/steps/CompanyOverviewStep.tsx`
- Add ONE simple question to existing Step 1:
  ```
  "Do you have documented processes/SOPs for your key business operations?"
  [ ] Yes, most processes are documented
  [ ] Some processes are documented  
  [ ] No, most processes are informal
  ```
- **Why**: This single data point dramatically improves AI recommendations without complexity

##### **Step 1.2: Simplify Contact Collection** 
- **Files**: `app/services/types.ts`
- Reduce contact fields to just name and email (remove phone, LinkedIn)
- **Why**: Removes friction without losing essential information

#### **Phase 2: Major Feature Enhancement - Agentic Workflow Redesign**

##### **Step 2.1: Redesign Workflow Visualization (High Priority)**
- **üìã Design Document**: See `AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md` for complete technical specification
- **Objective**: Transform ServiceNow-based visualization into AI Opportunities ‚Üí Workflow Architecture
- **Business Impact**: Complete the core flow with "Here's HOW the agentic system will work in YOUR business"

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Remove ServiceNow Dependencies**
   - Remove all ServiceNow integration code
   - Delete enterprise credential requirements
   - Simplify to focus on AI opportunity visualization

2. **Build AI-Powered Workflow Generation**
   - New service: `agenticWorkflowService.ts`
   - New API: `/api/workflow/generate-from-opportunities`
   - Input: User's AI opportunities + business context
   - Output: Custom agentic architecture diagrams

3. **Enhanced User Flow**
   ```
   Profile ‚Üí AI Opportunities ‚Üí "View Implementation" ‚Üí Custom Workflow Visualization
   ```

##### **Step 2.2: Quick Assessment Alternative (Optional Entry Point)**
- **Files**: New route `/quick-assessment` 
- Ultra-simple 5 questions that generate immediate AI insights:
  1. Industry + Company Size
  2. Top 2 business problems  
  3. Current systems (3-5 key ones)
  4. Process documentation level
  5. Biggest operational challenge
- **Why**: Instant value for busy executives, funnels to full profile

#### **Phase 3: Feature Simplification (Remove Complexity)**

##### **Step 3.1: Remove/Simplify Secondary Features**
- ‚ùå **Remove**: Markdown import (keep simple 2-step wizard)
- ‚ùå **Remove**: PDF export (screen viewing sufficient for MVP)
- ‚ùå **Remove**: Multiple timeline scenarios (default to "balanced")
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: Current 5-tab profile interface (works well)
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: Core AI Opportunities analysis (excellent)
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: Timeline generation (excellent)

#### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] One simple process question improves AI recommendations
- [ ] Agentic workflow visualization shows "HOW AI will work" for each opportunity
- [ ] Quick assessment provides value in <5 minutes  
- [ ] Main profile flow remains as simple as current
- [ ] Business leaders can complete everything without confusion
- [ ] Clear progression: Business ‚Üí Problems ‚Üí Value ‚Üí Implementation

#### **Why This Approach Works:**
- **Keeps Current Strengths**: Your 2-step wizard is already perfect
- **Completes Value Story**: Business ‚Üí Problems ‚Üí Value ‚Üí "How It Actually Works"
- **Builds Confidence**: Stakeholders see concrete implementation plans
- **Minimal Addition**: One question + workflow redesign (major value)
- **Removes Complexity**: Eliminates enterprise features that distract from core flow

## üìã Development Guidelines

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Modular Independence**: Features should be independently modifiable
- **Shared Infrastructure**: `aiService.ts`, `credentialsRepository.ts`, `profileRepository.ts`
- **Security First**: Service role + explicit user authorization in all API routes
- **Performance**: Use caching for expensive AI operations

### **Standard Patterns**
```typescript
// API Route Pattern
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);

// AI Service Usage
const result = await aiService.generateJson(
  systemPrompt,
  userPrompt,
  userId,
  CredentialsRepository,
  preferredProvider
);
```

### **Key Files Reference**
- **Types**: `app/services/types.ts` - Core data structures
- **Profile UI**: `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main profile interface
- **AI Service**: `app/services/aiService.ts` - Centralized AI provider
- **Profile Wizard**: `app/profiles/components/ProfileWizard.tsx` - Onboarding
- **AI Prompts**: `app/lib/llm/prompts/` - Prompt engineering
