## ‚úÖ Completed Milestones
*A reverse-chronological log of implemented features.*

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Frontend UI for Provider Selection (July 2025)
**What was implemented:**
- **Provider Selection UI**: Added a dropdown menu to the timeline sidebar that allows users to select their preferred AI provider.
- **Dynamic Provider Fetching**: Created a new API endpoint to fetch the list of available AI providers from the user's configured credentials.
- **State Management Integration**: Updated the central state management store to handle the selected provider.
- **Backend Integration**: Modified the timeline generation service and API routes to use the selected provider, allowing for on-the-fly switching between different AI models.

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Codebase Refactoring & Best Practices (June 2025)
**What was implemented:**
- **TypeScript Migration**: Converted key components and API routes to TypeScript, enabling strict type checking and improving code quality.
- **Styling Standardization**: Refactored all global CSS into component-specific CSS Modules, eliminating style conflicts and improving maintainability.
- **Component Architecture**: Broke down large components into smaller, single-purpose components for better reusability and clarity.
- **Production Readiness**: Implemented a robust, database-backed rate-limiting strategy and updated unstable dependencies to their latest stable versions.
- **Security Enhancements**: Addressed a critical security vulnerability by implementing session-based authentication for the timeline generation API route.

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Multi-Provider AI Backend (Phase 6.2)
**What was implemented:**
- **Provider-Agnostic AI Service**: Refactored the central `aiService` to be fully provider-agnostic. It now dynamically loads the correct AI provider based on the user's saved credentials in the admin interface.
- **Anthropic Claude Provider**: Created a new `claudeServerProvider.js` that correctly interfaces with the Anthropic Claude API, using the API key from the user's configuration.
- **Enhanced OpenAI Provider**: Updated `openaiServerProvider.js` to accept a runtime API key, allowing it to work with both user-configured credentials and the legacy environment variable fallback.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Resolved multiple bugs, including circular dependencies and UI rendering issues, to ensure the new multi-provider system is stable and reliable.
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Re-engineered the prompt-building logic to be significantly more effective. It now extracts key data from the structured profile object (not markdown) and uses an improved example structure to guide the AI, resulting in highly specific and relevant timeline generation.

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Codebase Health Check & Refactoring (January 2025)
**What was implemented:**
- **Component Consolidation**: Removed duplicate `AddServiceForm` components and centralized logic into a single reusable component in `app/admin/components/`.
- **Styling Consistency**: Replaced all inline styles on the main page (`app/page.js`) with a dedicated CSS Module (`app/Home.module.css`), ensuring consistency with the project's styling best practices.
- **Improved Navigation**: Refactored navigation in `ServiceNowConnector` to use Next.js's `useRouter` for client-side transitions, eliminating unnecessary full-page reloads.
- **Standardized Data Access**: Updated API routes (`/api/timeline/generate-from-profile`) to consistently use the `ProfileRepository`, centralizing data logic and improving maintainability.
- **API Authentication Fixes**: Corrected server-side authentication for database queries in API routes, ensuring Row Level Security policies are properly enforced and resolving caching issues.
- **Development Bug Fixes**: Addressed a React Strict Mode double-invocation issue in the `useTimeline` hook that caused duplicate AI generation calls.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed stray `console.log` statements and temporary development scripts from the codebase.

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Phase 6.1.5 - Admin Interface (January 2025)
**What was implemented:**
- **Unified Credential Management**: Created comprehensive admin interface for all external service credentials
- **Database Schema Extension**: Added `external_service_credentials` table supporting AI providers, CRM systems, and future integrations
- **Secure Credential Storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption with user-specific encrypted credential storage
- **Security Architecture**: Production-ready security model using application-level authentication with service role database access
- **Connection Testing**: Built API endpoints to test both saved and unsaved credentials for OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, ServiceNow, and HubSpot
- **Professional UI**: Complete admin interface at `/admin` with service tabs, credential cards, and real-time test functionality
- **Service Provider Support**: Full support for OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, ServiceNow, HubSpot, extensible for future services
- **User-Level Configuration**: Replaced environment variables with secure, user-specific credential management
- **Default Provider Management**: Users can set preferred default providers for each service type
- **Navigation Integration**: Added Settings link to GlobalHeader for easy access
- **Enhanced Form Experience**: Test-before-save functionality, comprehensive validation, smart error handling
- **Production Security Model**: Server-side API routes with JWT authentication, user-scoped data access, encrypted storage

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Phase 6.1 - Database-Backed Timeline Caching (January 2025)
**What was implemented:**
- **Cache-First Architecture**: Implemented intelligent caching system that checks database before generating new timelines
- **Server-Side Database Operations**: Refactored API route to use direct Supabase calls instead of client-side modules
- **Authentication Integration**: Enhanced frontend to pass user context for secure database operations
- **API Route Optimization**: Complete refactoring of `/api/timeline/generate-from-profile` with server-side caching logic
- **Frontend Integration**: Updated useBusinessProfileStore to include user authentication in API requests
- **Professional UX**: Cache status widget showing cached vs fresh timelines with regeneration controls
- **Complete Testing**: All 9 smoke tests passing ‚úÖ, full functionality verified

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Phase 6 - AI Integration (January 2025)
**What was implemented:**
- **Centralized AI Service Architecture**: Refactored all LLM interactions into a generic, reusable `aiService.js`. This central service manages different AI providers and is the single entry point for any feature requiring AI capabilities.
- **Provider-Agnostic Design**: The new architecture abstracts the specific LLM provider, with `openaiServerProvider.js` as the first concrete implementation. Foundation laid for multiple providers (Anthropic, Gemini).
- **Timeline Service Refactor**: `timelineService.js`
