### **AI Solutions Tab Redesign - Agentic Implementation Focus**

**Objective**: Transform the abstract "AI Opportunities" tab into concrete "AI Solutions" that showcase specific, implementable agentic AI systems. Each solution features autonomous agents with clear autonomy progression (Crawl > Walk > Run).

**Business Value**: 
- Shows concrete agentic implementations instead of abstract categories
- Provides clear autonomy maturation path from supervised to autonomous
- Directly ties to strategic initiatives for relevant, actionable solutions
- Positions platform as definitive guide for autonomous agent implementation

**Critical Success Factor**: Generate specific agentic solutions (autonomous agents) not traditional AI/ML, with realistic autonomy progression that builds executive confidence.

### **Solution Generation Strategy: Multi-Dimensional Mapping**

**Challenge**: Users have multiple strategic initiatives, each with multiple business problems, systems, and stakeholders. Solutions must be contextual and specific.

**Approach**: Multi-agent analysis system that maps business problems to specific agentic solutions:

#### **1. Initiative-Centric Generation**
Generate solutions **per strategic initiative**, analyzing each initiative's specific context:
- Initiative details (name, owner, budget, timeline)
- Specific business problems for that initiative
- Related systems and dependencies
- Company-wide context (industry, size, existing systems)

#### **2. Problem-Solution Mapping Engine**
Use pattern matching to identify appropriate agentic solutions:
```typescript
interface ProblemSolutionMapping {
  problemPatterns: string[];           // ["downtime", "maintenance", "equipment failure"]
  agenticSolution: AgenticSolutionTemplate;
  requiredSystems: string[];           // ["ERP", "IoT sensors", "CMMS"]
  industryApplicability: string[];     // ["Manufacturing", "Energy"]
}
```

#### **3. Multi-Agent Solution Generator**
Three specialized agents analyze profile data:
- **Business Problem Analyzer**: Identifies root causes, interconnections, required capabilities
- **System Integration Analyst**: Evaluates existing systems, APIs, integration complexity
- **Agentic Solution Architect**: Designs specific autonomous agent systems with roles, tools, autonomy phases

#### **4. Contextual Prompts**
Each agent gets full context but focuses on specific analysis:
- Problem Analyzer: Industry + problems + owner constraints
- System Analyst: Existing systems + required capabilities + integration feasibility  
- Solution Architect: Problem analysis + system constraints + agentic architecture design

#### **5. Solution Validation & Ranking**
Generated solutions are validated for:
- Feasibility (integration with existing systems)
- ROI (specific to identified problems)
- Complexity (appropriate for owner's technical level)
- Time to value (realistic implementation timeline)

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Modular Independence**: Features should be independently modifiable
- **Shared Infrastructure**: `aiService.ts`, `credentialsRepository.ts`, `profileRepository.ts`
- **Security First**: Service role + explicit user authorization in all API routes
- **Performance**: Use caching for expensive AI operations

### **Standard Patterns**
```typescript
// API Route Pattern
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id);

// AI Service Usage
const result = await aiService.generateJson(
  systemPrompt,
  userPrompt,
  userId,
  CredentialsRepository,
  preferredProvider
);
```

### **Key Files Reference**
- **Types**: `app/services/types.ts` - Core data structures
- **Profile UI**: `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main profile interface
- **AI Service**: `app/services/aiService.ts` - Centralized AI provider
- **Profile Wizard**: `app/profiles/components/ProfileWizard.tsx` - Onboarding
