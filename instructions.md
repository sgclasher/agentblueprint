## Gemini Model Name Troubleshooting (June 2025)

### Problem
- Timeline generation with Google Gemini failed with a 404 error: `models/gemini-2.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent.`

### Root Cause
- The model name `gemini-2.5-flash` is **not valid** for the Gemini API. 
- The admin UI was offering invalid model names as options to users.
- Google requires exact model names, which change frequently and may include preview or version suffixes.

### Solution ✅ FIXED
- **Updated Admin UI**: Replaced invalid model options with current valid model names
- **Updated Provider Default**: Changed default from `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` to `gemini-1.5-flash`
- **Added Tests**: Created validation tests to prevent future invalid model issues

### Current Valid Model Names (June 2025)
- `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05` ⭐ (Most Advanced - New!)
- `gemini-1.5-flash` ⭐ (Recommended - Fast & Versatile)
- `gemini-1.5-pro` (Advanced Reasoning)
- `gemini-2.0-flash` (Latest Stable)
- `gemini-1.5-flash-8b` (Fast & Efficient)
- `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` (Experimental Preview)

### Troubleshooting Steps for Users
1. If you see a 404 error from the Gemini API, check the model name in your provider configuration.
2. Go to `/admin` and edit your Google Gemini provider
3. Select a valid model from the dropdown (invalid options have been removed)
4. Test the connection and save
5. Try timeline regeneration again

### For Developers
- **Always check** the [official Gemini API model list](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) for up-to-date names
- **Update admin UI options** when Google releases new models or deprecates old ones
- **Test model names** before adding them to the admin UI dropdown

### Files Updated
- `app/admin/components/AddServiceForm.tsx` - Updated valid model options
- `app/lib/llm/providers/googleServerProvider.ts` - Fixed default model name
- `app/__tests__/features/google-provider.test.ts` - Added model validation tests
- `instructions.md` - Updated troubleshooting documentation

## ✅ COMPLETED: Fix Provider Selection Display Bug

### **🎉 SUCCESS - Provider Selection Working Correctly!**

#### Problem Identified:
- User selected "OpenAI (AI)" from dropdown but frontend displayed wrong provider info
- Backend was correctly using OpenAI but UI showed "Google gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05"

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. ✅ **Backend Provider Selection**: Working correctly - OpenAI was properly selected and used
2. ✅ **Timeline Generation**: Working correctly - OpenAI generated successful timeline
3. ❌ **Frontend Display Bug**: UI was showing wrong provider information due to:
   - Missing provider parameter in `useTimeline.regenerateTimeline()` function
   - API response showing default provider status instead of requested provider status

#### What Was Fixed:
- **✅ Provider Parameter Flow**: Fixed `useTimeline.regenerateTimeline()` to accept and pass provider parameter
- **✅ API Response Accuracy**: Updated API route to return status of actual provider used, not default provider
- **✅ Type Safety**: Removed `as any` type assertions and implemented proper TypeScript interfaces

#### Implementation Details:
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/hooks/useTimeline.ts` - Fixed provider parameter passing
  - `app/timeline/components/TimelineSidebar.tsx` - Updated interface for provider parameter
  - `app/timeline/page.tsx` - Removed type assertion workaround
  - `app/api/timeline/generate-from-profile/route.ts` - Fixed provider status response

### **🚀 Results Achieved:**
- **Provider Selection**: ✅ Working correctly across all providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
- **UI Display**: ✅ Shows correct provider information in console and response
- **Timeline Generation**: ✅ Successfully uses selected provider for generation
- **Type Safety**: ✅ Proper TypeScript typing throughout provider selection flow

## ✅ COMPLETED: Fix OpenAI Model Configuration Issue

### **🎉 SUCCESS - OpenAI Now Uses Correct Model from Admin UI!**

#### Problem Identified:
- User selected "GPT-4o (Recommended)" in admin UI but timeline was using "GPT-4.1"
- OpenAI provider was ignoring user's model selection from database

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. ✅ **Provider Selection**: Working correctly - OpenAI was properly selected
2. ✅ **Admin UI**: Working correctly - GPT-4o was properly saved to database  
3. ❌ **Provider Constructor**: OpenAI provider wasn't accepting model parameter like other providers
4. ❌ **Model Override**: Hardcoded `gpt-4.1` in constructor instead of using user's choice

#### What Was Fixed:
- **✅ Constructor Updated**: OpenAI provider now accepts `model` parameter like Google/Claude providers
- **✅ Model Logging**: Added model logging to show which model is actually being used  
- **✅ Dynamic Status**: Updated `getStatus()` to show actual model instead of hardcoded text
- **✅ Default Model**: Changed default from `gpt-4.1` to `gpt-4o` for better user experience

#### Implementation Details:
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/lib/llm/providers/openaiServerProvider.ts` - Fixed constructor and model handling
  - `app/__tests__/features/google-provider.test.ts` - Added OpenAI provider tests
- **Model Parameter**: Now properly flows: Admin UI → Database → aiService → OpenAI Provider
- **Validation**: Added tests for all latest 2025 models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o1 series)

### **🚀 Results Achieved:**
- **Model Selection**: ✅ OpenAI now uses exact model selected in admin UI (GPT-4o, o1, etc.)
- **Provider Parity**: ✅ All providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) handle models consistently  
- **User Control**: ✅ Users can select any valid model and it will be used correctly
- **Logging**: ✅ Console shows "Model: gpt-4o" to confirm correct model usage

## ✅ COMPLETED: Fix Claude Authentication and JSON Parsing Issues

### **🎉 SUCCESS - Claude Fully Working for Timeline Generation!**

#### Problem Identified:
- User tried to create Claude provider with "claude-sonnet-4" but connection test failed initially  
- After fixing model names, Claude authentication was failing with "401 - Invalid bearer token"
- After fixing authentication, Claude JSON parsing was failing due to markdown code blocks

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. ❌ **Invalid Model Name**: "claude-sonnet-4" is not a valid Anthropic model identifier
2. ❌ **Wrong Authentication Header**: Using `Authorization: Bearer` instead of `x-api-key`
3. ❌ **JSON Parsing Issue**: Claude wraps JSON responses in markdown code blocks

#### What Was Fixed:
- **✅ Correct Model Names**: Updated admin UI to use official Anthropic model identifiers
- **✅ Authentication Header**: Fixed ClaudeServerProvider to use `x-api-key` header instead of `Authorization: Bearer`
- **✅ JSON Parsing**: Added markdown code block stripping in ClaudeServerProvider before JSON parsing
- **✅ Model Logging**: Added model logging to show which Claude model is being used

#### Valid Claude Models (2025):
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` ⭐ (Latest Claude Sonnet 4 - May 2025)
- `claude-opus-4-20250514` ⭐ (Most Intelligent - May 2025)  
- `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` (Hybrid Reasoning - Feb 2025)
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (Recommended - Fast & Capable)
- `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (Fast & Efficient)
- `claude-3-opus-20240229` (Advanced Reasoning)

#### Implementation Details:
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/admin/components/AddServiceForm.tsx` - Updated Claude model options
  - `app/lib/llm/providers/claudeServerProvider.ts` - Fixed authentication header, default model, and JSON parsing
  - `app/__tests__/features/google-provider.test.ts` - Added comprehensive Claude tests

#### Technical Fixes:
1. **Authentication**: Changed from `'Authorization': 'Bearer ${apiKey}'` to `'x-api-key': apiKey`
2. **JSON Parsing**: Added code to strip ````json` and ```` ` markers before parsing
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and logging for debugging

### **🚀 Results Achieved:**
- **Claude Authentication**: ✅ Proper API key authentication working
- **Claude JSON Generation**: ✅ Successful JSON timeline generation with markdown stripping
- **Timeline Generation**: ✅ Claude generates excellent detailed timelines (20+ seconds processing time)
- **Provider Consistency**: ✅ All providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) working perfectly
