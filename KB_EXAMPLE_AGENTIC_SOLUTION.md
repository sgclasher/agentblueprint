# AI-Driven RFx Lifecycle — Agentic Solution Design

*A framework-agnostic reference in Markdown*

---

## 1 | Executive Summary

Deploy a modular team of AI agents—each with a clear mandate, toolset, and hand-off contract—to drive every stage of an RFx (Request for *X*) process.
The **manager-worker** pattern ensures tight governance, parallelised work where useful, and an auditable record of every decision. Expected outcomes:

| KPI                     | Target Improvement               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| RFx cycle time          | **-40–60 %**                     |
| Evaluation consistency  | **+30 %** rubric alignment       |
| Stakeholder hours saved | **100 + hrs** per enterprise RFx |
| Vendor satisfaction     | **+20 %** response score         |

```

* **Coordinators (Managers)**: 5, one per phase
* **Worker Agents**: 2–3 per phase, each runs a ReAct + Tool-Use loop
* **Shared Assets**: Vector/graph memory for RFx records, approval guardrails, audit log

## 4 | Phase-by-Phase Logic

### 1. Request Intake & Validation

* **Trigger:** Business user submits RFx request.
* **Flow:**

  1. *Intake Specialist* logs & enriches request.
  2. *Validator* checks completeness (dates, budget, reqs).
  3. *Approval Coordinator* launches approval workflow if “Validated”, else routes for revision.

### 2. Document Generation

* **Trigger:** Request receives final approval.
* **Flow:**

  1. *Data Retriever* pulls approved data.
  2. *Document Creator* invokes AI generator → produces branded RFx package → attaches to record.

### 3. Vendor Q\&A

* **Trigger:** Supplier posts a question linked to RFx.
* **Flow:**

  1. *Question Pre-Processor* associates Q with parent RFx & classifies topic.
  2. *Answer Generator* drafts policy-aligned reply, posts it, updates audit log.

### 4. Vendor Evaluation

* **Trigger:** Proposal enters “Evaluation”.
* **Flow:**

  1. *Submission Intake* verifies documents.
  2. *Proposal Evaluator* scores versus requirements via AI tool.
  3. *Scoring Coordinator* normalises scores (High/Med/Low) & stores summary.

### 5. Finalist Comparison & Award

* **Trigger:** All evaluations complete.
* **Flow:**

  1. *Comparison Analyst* generates side-by-side view of top vendors.
  2. *Decision Support* crafts justification memo with ROI & risk notes.
  3. *Award Communicator* drafts winner letter & courteous rejections; queues for exec sign-off.

## 5 | Cross-Cutting Practices

| Concern               | Implementation Note                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory / State**    | Store RFx data, Q\&A, scores in a vector/graph DB; expose as a read-only “Memory Tool”.                                                             |
| **Guardrails & HITL** | Approval gates & award sign-off callable as `require_human_approval(payload)`.                                                                      |
| **Observability**     | Log every agent action & tool call with timestamps for audit.                                                                                       |
| **Cost Control**      | Use Plan-and-Execute pattern if volumes spike—large LLM for planning, cheaper model for execution.                                                  |
| **Extensibility**     | Add new worker agents under any manager without editing other phases; or switch managers to an event-bus (blackboard) if massive scale is required. |

## 6 | Implementation Checklist

* [ ] Register shared tools (read/write RFx, AI Doc Gen, AI Eval, etc.) once—re-use across agents.
* [ ] Define JSON schema for each agent’s inputs/outputs to enforce contracts.
* [ ] Configure parallel execution where safe (e.g., multiple *Answer Generators*).
* [ ] Stand-up monitoring dashboard for cycle-time, score distribution, agent cost.
* [ ] Pilot with a low-risk RFx to validate guardrails and human-approval points.

## 7 | Next-Step Recommendations

1. **Prototype** the Intake & Document phases first (quickest ROI).
2. **Instrument** every agent call for latency/cost; tune model sizes accordingly.
3. **Iterate** on evaluation rubrics with procurement SMEs to lock-in fairness.
4. **Roll-out** remaining phases once accuracy and compliance thresholds are met.
