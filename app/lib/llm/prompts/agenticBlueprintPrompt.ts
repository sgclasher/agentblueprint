// üîç AUDIT FINDINGS - CURRENT PROMPT QUALITY ASSESSMENT
// =====================================================
// Based on KB_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_MVP.md standards and quality test results:
//
// ‚úÖ STRENGTHS:
// - Comprehensive 5-agent team model (coordinator, researcher, analyst, quality-checker, actuator)
// - Progressive trust framework (crawl-walk-run) properly defined
// - Human oversight checkpoints align with KB standards
// - Structured JSON output format ensures consistency
//
// ‚ùå CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED:
// 1. **Business Context Utilization** (Business Specificity Score: 10/25)
//    - Generic agent descriptions not tailored to industry
//    - Profile systems referenced but not deeply integrated into agent roles
//    - Business problems mentioned but not mapped to specific agent capabilities
//    - Industry terminology missing from agent job descriptions
//
// 2. **KPI Alignment Issues** (Calculated alignment < 0.8)
//    - KPI improvements not directly derived from strategic initiative problems
//    - Improvement percentages not based on business context or industry benchmarks
//    - Agent-to-KPI linkage too generic, not considering actual business workflows
//
// 3. **Implementation Specificity**
//    - Timelines generic (24 weeks) regardless of business size or complexity
//    - Risk mitigations not tailored to industry-specific challenges
//    - Tool assignments don't leverage full profile system inventory
//
// üéØ IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES:
// Phase 2: Enhanced business context processing
// Phase 3: Industry-specific prompt variations and dynamic assembly
// Phase 4: AI-powered quality validation and scoring

// üéØ PHASE 3: ADVANCED PROMPT ENGINEERING - RESTRUCTURED ARCHITECTURE
// ===================================================================
// This refactored system integrates:
// ‚úÖ Industry-specific intelligence (Phase 3.1 complete)
// ‚úÖ KB_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW_MVP.md agent cooperation patterns

CORE AGENTIC BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK:

**THE 5-AGENT DIGITAL TEAM MODEL:**

1. **COORDINATOR (Project Manager)**
   - Role: Breaks overall goals into bite-sized tasks, sets deadlines, assigns work
   - Tools: Calendar systems, task trackers, project management platforms
   - Oversight: Policy-checked autonomy - can plan but not finalize actions
   - KPI Impact: Project completion rates, timeline adherence, resource optimization

2. **RESEARCHER (Analyst)**
   - Role: Digs up data and documents needed for decision-making
   - Tools: Internal search engines, knowledge bases, web search (if allowed), databases
   - Oversight: Human-in-the-loop - output reviewed for accuracy and relevance
   - KPI Impact: Data quality, research speed, information completeness

3. **ANALYST/WRITER (Consultant)**
   - Role: Turns raw data into insights, drafts reports, creates recommendations
   - Tools: BI query systems, spreadsheet formulas, text generation, analysis platforms
   - Oversight: Policy-checked autonomy - quality bot flags anomalies for human review
   - KPI Impact: Insight quality, report generation speed, decision support effectiveness

4. **QUALITY-CHECKER (Auditor)**
   - Role: Reviews team output, finds mistakes, enforces brand/compliance rules
   - Tools: Style guides, policy engines, plagiarism scanners, compliance frameworks
   - Oversight: Full autonomy for low-risk edits, human escalation for high-risk items
   - KPI Impact: Error reduction, compliance adherence, output consistency

5. **ACTUATOR (Operations Specialist)**
   - Role: Pushes approved changes into live systems (updates records, sends emails, executes transactions)
   - Tools: ERP write APIs, email gateways, RPA bots, system integrations
   - Oversight: Human approval required initially, progresses to policy-guarded autonomy
   - KPI Impact: Process automation, execution speed, operational efficiency

**HUMAN CONTROL FRAMEWORK:**

1. **Kick-off Workshop**
   - What: Confirm KPIs, success criteria, risk constraints with leadership
   - Why: Ensures agents solve the right problem and align with business objectives
   - Frequency: One-time per initiative

2. **Review Gates**
   - What: Human review of Researcher/Analyst outputs flagged as "needs approval"
   - Why: Catches context mistakes and ensures quality before downstream actions
   - Frequency: Periodic based on output confidence scores

3. **Exception Escalations**
   - What: Immediate notification when risk scores spike (privacy breaches, compliance violations)
   - Why: Maintains human accountability for edge cases and high-risk scenarios
   - Frequency: As-needed based on automated risk assessment

4. **Quarterly Tune-Up**
   - What: Inspect logs, adjust guardrails, set new KPIs, update success criteria
   - Why: Continuous improvement and governance evolution
   - Frequency: Quarterly review cycles

**PROGRESSIVE TRUST MODEL (CRAWL-WALK-RUN):**

**CRAWL Phase (Weeks 1-8):**
- Human approval for all agent actions
- Read-only access to systems
- Manual review of all outputs
- Strict guardrails and safety checks
- Focus: Proof of concept and trust building

**WALK Phase (Weeks 9-20):**
- Policy-checked autonomy for low-risk tasks
- Limited write access to non-critical systems
- Automated quality gates with human escalation
- Expanded tool access based on performance
- Focus: Selective automation and capability expansion

**RUN Phase (Weeks 21+):**
- Full autonomy for approved workflows
- Complete system access within security boundaries
- Exception-based human intervention only
- Continuous learning and optimization
- Focus: Full-scale automation and business transformation`;
