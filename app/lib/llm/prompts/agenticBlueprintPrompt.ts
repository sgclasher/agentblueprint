- Progressive trust building from human control to automation
${config.includeROIProjection ? '- Defensible ROI projections based on process metrics' : ''}

**CRITICAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Apply the Dynamic Agent Role Generation Framework to create industry-specific agent titles
- Use the Workflow Specificity Template to ensure detailed trigger ‚Üí flow ‚Üí outcome patterns
- Reference actual company systems and strategic initiative problems throughout
- Ensure every agent title reflects the specific business context and industry terminology
- Validate that workflows demonstrate clear cooperation patterns and handoff contracts

**MANDATORY BUSINESS PROCESS NARRATIVE:**
Your response MUST tell a coherent story that maps to actual business processes:
1. **Process Sequence**: Agents must work in logical sequence from process initiation to completion
2. **Handoff Chain**: Each agent must clearly pass work to the next agent with specific deliverables
3. **Business Flow**: The overall workflow must solve the exact business problems listed in the initiative
4. **End-to-End Story**: Must have clear beginning (business trigger) ‚Üí middle (process steps) ‚Üí end (measurable outcome)
5. **Domain Expertise**: Must demonstrate deep understanding of the industry's core business processes

**PROCUREMENT EXAMPLE PATTERN:**
For procurement initiatives, the story should flow: Request Analysis ‚Üí Vendor Research ‚Üí RFx Management ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Award
For manufacturing: Demand Planning ‚Üí Resource Allocation ‚Üí Production Scheduling ‚Üí Quality Control ‚Üí Delivery
For healthcare: Patient Assessment ‚Üí Care Planning ‚Üí Treatment Delivery ‚Üí Quality Monitoring ‚Üí Outcome Tracking

**WORKFLOW DETAIL VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
Every agent's Core Job description MUST include:
‚úÖ **TRIGGER**: Specific business event or condition that activates this agent
‚úÖ **FLOW**: Step-by-step process with decision points, validations, and tool interactions
‚úÖ **OUTCOME**: Measurable result that advances the business objective and enables next steps
‚úÖ **TOOL INTEGRATION**: Exact systems, APIs, data sources, and output formats
‚úÖ **HANDOFF PROTOCOL**: How work passes to next agent or human with specific deliverables
‚úÖ **QUALITY GATES**: Validation checkpoints and error handling procedures
‚úÖ **BUSINESS TERMINOLOGY**: Industry-specific language that reflects actual business processes

**EXAMPLES OF REQUIRED DETAIL LEVEL:**
‚ùå INSUFFICIENT: "Analyzes data and creates reports"
‚úÖ REQUIRED: "TRIGGER: When production planning cycle begins each Monday at 6 AM... FLOW: Agent queries SAP ERP production module via BAPI interfaces, extracts demand forecasts for next 4 weeks, cross-references with inventory levels from WMS system, calculates optimal production schedules using constraint-based algorithms, generates capacity utilization reports in Excel format... OUTCOME: Production schedule approved by human supervisor is uploaded to MES system, triggering material procurement workflows and workforce scheduling"

**OUTPUT FORMAT:** You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. No markdown formatting, no explanations, no additional text.

‚ö†Ô∏è **FINAL REMINDER**: The kpiImprovements array MUST contain at least 3 items. This is strictly validated.
