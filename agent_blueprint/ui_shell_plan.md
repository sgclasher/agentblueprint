# MISSION

Our mission is to build an AI Business Advisory Platform that empowers businesses to confidently adopt and implement agentic AI. We are not just building another software tool; we are creating a strategic bridge between complex business problems and tangible, high-ROI artificial intelligence solutions.

For our clients, navigating the world of agentic AI in mid-2025 is filled with both massive opportunities and significant risks. They see the potential for huge productivity gains and cost reductions but are often blocked by a lack of clear implementation paths, uncertain ROI, and governance challenges.

**Our Vision: To be the definitive platform that transforms AI ambiguity into actionable strategy.**

Here's what that means for what we are building:

1.  **We Demystify AI Strategy**: Our platform starts by providing an "Instant AI Readiness Assessment" and identifying concrete "AI Opportunities" across six business categories. We translate a company's high-level goals into specific, vetted use cases where agentic AI can make a real impact. This moves the conversation from abstract potential to a focused plan.

2.  **We Make ROI Concrete**: A key feature is our ability to generate clear ROI projections and a full "Executive ROI Business Case." By analyzing a business's specific metrics, we can project financial returns, payback periods, and overall value, giving leaders the financial confidence they need to invest.

3.  **We Create Actionable Blueprints**: The core of our platform is the "AI Digital Team Blueprint." This is where we turn strategy into an executable plan. We don't just suggest a solution; we generate a detailed blueprint that includes:
    * **Specialized AI Agents** designed for the specific task.
    * The optimal **Agentic Design Pattern** (like Manager-Workers or Plan-and-Execute) based on proven industry best practices.
    * Clear **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** checkpoints for safety and oversight, a non-negotiable for high-stakes domains.

4.  **We Engineer for Trust and Scalability**: Our platform is built on a secure, provider-agnostic architecture that supports leading AI models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. With features like intelligent caching, encrypted credentials, and timeline persistence, we provide an enterprise-grade experience that is both efficient and secure.

Ultimately, every feature we build serves a single purpose: to guide a business from initial curiosity to a successful, value-driven implementation of agentic AI. We are building the engine that will power the agentic enterprise.

## üöÄ The Game Plan: A Decoupled, UI-First Approach

To avoid the complexities of prompt engineering and create a maintainable, scalable UI, we will follow a **Decoupled, Contract-First** architecture. This plan focuses exclusively on rebuilding the **Business Profile** page as a standalone UI shell. Other pages (Admin, Timeline, Auth) are out of scope for this initial phase.

### Core Philosophy: The 3-Layer Architecture

We will treat the UI, Backend, and AI layers as separate systems that communicate through strict data contracts. This isolates the "messy" and unpredictable nature of AI from the UI, ensuring the UI remains stable and easy to work on.

1.  **The UI (This Project)**: Built in isolation against a perfect, predefined data structure (the "contract"). It knows nothing about AI.
2.  **The Backend API (The "Clean-up" Layer)**: Its job is to call the AI layer and then relentlessly clean, format, and transform the AI's messy output until it perfectly matches the UI's data contract.
3.  **The AI Engine (The "Messy" Layer)**: The world of prompts, LLMs, and unpredictable output. This layer is completely hidden from the UI.

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Build the UI Shell in Isolation

**Goal**: Create a fully functional, pixel-perfect Business Profile page that runs entirely on static, mock data. No API calls will be made in this phase.

### Phase 1 Tasks:

- [x] **Task 1.1: Define the "Perfect Data Contract"** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
    - **Action**: Create a new file `agent_blueprint/src/lib/types.ts`.
    - **Details**: In this file, we will define all the TypeScript `types` and `interfaces` needed to render the *entire* Business Profile page and its six tabs. This includes types for `BusinessProfile`, `AIOpportunity`, `AIBlueprint`, `System`, `Contact`, and `Analysis`. This contract will be our "single source of truth" for all UI development.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces created for all 6 tabs

- [x] **Task 1.2: Create Mock Data** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
    - **Action**: Create a new file `agent_blueprint/src/lib/mock-data.ts`.
    - **Details**: Populate this file with mock data that perfectly adheres to the interfaces defined in `types.ts`. This data should be rich and varied enough to build all UI components for all six tabs.
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Rich mock data created for "TechFlow Solutions" with realistic business scenarios

- [x] **Task 1.3: Build the Main Page Layout** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
    - **Action**: Modify `agent_blueprint/src/app/page.tsx`.
    - **Details**: Re-create the main layout of the Business Profile page. This will include a main container and the primary `Tabs` component from `shadcn/ui` with triggers for the six main tabs: "Overview", "Analysis", "AI Opportunities", "AI Blueprint", "Systems", and "Contacts".
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Professional layout with header, quick stats dashboard, and 6-tab navigation

- [x] **Task 1.4: Technical Foundation Setup** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
    - **Action**: Resolve technical issues and ensure stable development environment
    - **Details**: 
      - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Lightningcss dependency issue resolved by migrating from Tailwind v4 (alpha) to stable Tailwind v3
      - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Updated PostCSS configuration for compatibility
      - ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Converted CSS variables from OKLCH to HSL format for shadcn/ui compatibility
      - ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: Development server running successfully on http://localhost:3000 (or available port)
    - **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Stable development environment with no errors

- [ ] **Task 1.5: Implement UI for Each Tab**
    - **Details**: Build out the `TabsContent` for each tab one by one, using the mock data. Each tab will be a self-contained set of components.
    - **Current Status**: Overview tab fully implemented with professional UI
    - **Sub-Tasks**:
        - [x] **Overview Tab**: ‚úÖ Complete - Company profile, strategic initiatives, recent activity, progress indicators, alerts
        - [x] **AI Opportunities Tab**: Create the components to display a list of AI opportunities in cards, showing details like category, ROI, and status.
        - [x] **AI Blueprint Tab**: Build the UI to render the detailed AI Blueprint, including the executive summary, ROI visualization, digital team members, and timeline.
        - [ ] **Analysis Tab**: Develop the components to show the AI Readiness Score and other analytical charts/graphs.
        - [ ] **Systems Tab**: Implement the UI to list the company's current systems and applications.
        - [ ] **Contacts Tab**: Create the UI to display a list of key contacts.
