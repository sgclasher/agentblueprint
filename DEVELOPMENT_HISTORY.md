## 🔧 **Critical Database Migration Record**

### **AI Blueprint Caching Support**
**CRITICAL**: Before testing AI Blueprint functionality, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add agentic_blueprint_cache column to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS agentic_blueprint_cache JSONB;

-- Add index for efficient querying of cached blueprints
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_agentic_blueprint_cache 
ON profiles USING gin (agentic_blueprint_cache) 
WHERE agentic_blueprint_cache IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify the column was added successfully
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_name = 'profiles' 
        AND column_name = 'agentic_blueprint_cache'
    ) THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Successfully added agentic_blueprint_cache column to profiles table';
    ELSE
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Failed to add agentic_blueprint_cache column to profiles table';
    END IF;
END $$; 
```

### **Testing Verification Steps**
After running the migration:
1. **Generate a Blueprint**: Go to `/profile` → AI Blueprint tab → "Generate Blueprint"
2. **Test Persistence**: Refresh the page - blueprint should remain
3. **Test Cross-Provider**: Try different AI providers in `/admin`
4. **UI Verification**: Confirm text shows "5 Specialist Agents"
5. **Test Agentic Patterns**: Verify blueprints include selectedPattern and patternRationale
6. **Test Special Instructions**: Try custom instructions and verify they influence outputs

### **Phase 3: Advanced Prompt Engineering & Integration** ✅ **FOUNDATION COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Replace silent error fallbacks with strict validation and comprehensive logging system.

**Achievement**: Strict validation and comprehensive logging system prevents corrupted or incomplete data from being saved and provides detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting.

**Current Status**: System successfully identifies validation failures, revealing the need for prompt engineering refinement to ensure schema compliance.

**Implementation Plan Completed**:

#### 3.1 - 3.4: Advanced Prompt Engineering ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Industry Intelligence Layer**: Complete (`app/lib/llm/prompts/industryContextPrompts.ts`)
- [x] **Restructured System Prompt**: Complete (`app/lib/llm/prompts/agenticBlueprintPrompt.ts`)
- [x] **Enhanced User Prompt Builder**: Complete (`app/lib/llm/prompts/agenticBlueprintPrompt.ts`)
- [x] **Latest Model Capabilities**: Complete (`app/services/agenticBlueprintService.ts`)

### **Phase 3.5: Fix Prompt Compliance for KPI Improvements** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Major Achievement**: Successfully resolved the AI provider compliance issue where models (especially Gemini) were consistently failing validation by generating only 1 KPI improvement instead of the required 3+. The solution involved comprehensive prompt engineering refinements and intelligent retry logic.

**What Was Accomplished**:
- ✅ Enhanced prompt engineering with explicit KPI requirements and better JSON schema examples
- ✅ Added provider-specific optimizations (Gemini adaptive thinking, Claude extended thinking, OpenAI structured outputs)
- ✅ Implemented intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff and prompt adjustments
- ✅ Fixed provider detection to use actual provider from aiService instead of preferredProvider
- ✅ Updated UI text from "5 Specialists" to "5 Specialist Agents"
- ✅ Comprehensive testing with 11/11 tests passing
- ✅ Blueprint persistence already implemented correctly

  - Basic tab structure with loading states
  - Section layout: Objective → Team → Workflow → Oversight → Timeline

- [x] **Add tab to profile page** (`app/profile/page.tsx`)
  - Add 6th tab: "AI Blueprint"
  - Wire up tab switching logic

#### **Phase 2: Agent Team Generation** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Create blueprint prompt system** (`app/lib/llm/prompts/agenticBlueprintPrompt.ts`)
  - System prompt for generating digital team based on business profile
  - Structured output for 5 agent types with role mapping
  - KPI linkage for each agent

- [x] **Implement blueprint generation service** (`app/services/agenticBlueprintService.ts`)
  - Service to call AI and generate team blueprint
  - Map business problems to agent capabilities
  - Generate human oversight recommendations

- [x] **Create API route** (`app/api/profiles/generate-blueprint/route.ts`)
  - Secure endpoint for blueprint generation
  - Leverage existing aiService infrastructure
  - Cache results in profile data

**Database Migration Required**: `app/database/agentic-blueprint-schema.sql`

---

## 🔧 **Critical Database Migration Record**

### **AI Blueprint Caching Support**
**CRITICAL**: Before testing AI Blueprint functionality, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add agentic_blueprint_cache column to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS agentic_blueprint_cache JSONB;

-- Add index for efficient querying of cached blueprints
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_agentic_blueprint_cache 
ON profiles USING gin (agentic_blueprint_cache) 
WHERE agentic_blueprint_cache IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify the column was added successfully
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_name = 'profiles' 
        AND column_name = 'agentic_blueprint_cache'
    ) THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Successfully added agentic_blueprint_cache column to profiles table';
    ELSE
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Failed to add agentic_blueprint_cache column to profiles table';
    END IF;
END $$; 
```

### **Testing Verification Steps**
After running the migration:
1. **Generate a Blueprint**: Go to `/profile` → AI Blueprint tab → "Generate Blueprint"
2. **Test Persistence**: Refresh the page - blueprint should remain
3. **Test Cross-Provider**: Try different AI providers in `/admin` to see provider-specific optimizations
4. **UI Verification**: Confirm text shows "5 Specialist Agents" (updated from "5 Specialists")
