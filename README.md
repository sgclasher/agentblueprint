## Troubleshooting

### Google Gemini Model Name Errors

If you encounter a 404 error when using Google Gemini (e.g., `models/gemini-2.5-pro is not found for API version v1beta`), this means the model name is incorrect. 

**Current Correct Model Names:**
- ✅ `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05` (NOT `gemini-2.5-pro`)
- ✅ `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` (NOT `gemini-2.5-flash`)
- ✅ `gemini-1.5-flash` (stable)
- ✅ `gemini-1.5-pro` (stable)

**Solution:**
- Edit your Gemini provider in the admin UI and use the correct preview model names
- The 2.5 models are still in preview status and require the full preview names
- Always check the [official Gemini API model list](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) for latest valid names
- Save and test the connection before using

### **Admin UI and Provider Selection**
- The admin dashboard supports robust credential management for all AI providers
- Provider selection is fully dynamic and works with correct model names
- If you encounter errors, check your provider configuration and use the correct model names above
