# Agent Blueprint & Business AI Advisory Platform

**ü§ñ AI Assistant Context:** This is a comprehensive business AI advisory platform built with Next.js, featuring ServiceNow agentic AI flow visualization, interactive AI transformation timelines, and client profile management with structured business intelligence framework. The platform serves as a sophisticated business intelligence tool combining technical visualization capabilities with comprehensive data collection and strategic planning tools. Core technologies: Next.js 15, React 19, ReactFlow, Zustand, Dagre, Supabase. Design inspired by ai-2027.com with modern dark themes and floating UI elements.

**üéØ Current State:** Fully functional platform with **Phase 6 AI Integration** mostly complete! Features real OpenAI GPT-4o powered timeline generation with intelligent, industry-specific business transformation roadmaps. **Client profiles are now exclusively stored in Supabase, requiring user authentication for all profile-related features.** This change removes all `localStorage` fallback and data migration logic, streamlining the architecture. **‚ö†Ô∏è Two urgent issues need fixing: timeline progress bar not updating with scroll, and missing timeline caching (regenerates on every page refresh).** All four core features have consistent UI theming across all pages with **Phase 5 UI Consistency & Design System** including global CSS variables, theme provider, and standardized GlobalHeader. All pages (ServiceNow, Profiles, Timeline, Auth) have consistent professional theming with working light/dark mode toggle. The core `ProfileWizard` component has been refactored to use CSS Modules, eliminating inline styles for robust, theme-aware consistency. **Latest enhancements include AI-powered timeline generation, working edit profile functionality, ProfileWizard UX improvements with clickable step navigation and free exploration, and enhanced visual indicators for completion status.** Recent updates include user profile management page, improved tag readability in light mode, and enhanced header navigation with clickable user profiles. Complete with ServiceNow visualization, **AI-powered transformation timeline**, comprehensive client profile management system with full edit capability, complete user authentication, and a secure Supabase database backend. The platform features sophisticated UI inspired by ai-2027.com with backdrop blur effects, gradient backgrounds, professional typography, and responsive mobile-optimized layouts. Architecture includes robust service layers with secure multi-user authentication and row-level security. Ready for production deployment and enterprise use.

**üöÄ Next Steps:** 
1. **URGENT**: Fix timeline progress bar not updating with scroll (left sidebar issue)
2. **URGENT**: Implement timeline caching to prevent regeneration on page refresh + add "Regenerate Timeline" button
3. PDF export capabilities, multi-platform connectors, and timeline collaboration features
4. Focus on creating a scalable, secure platform for enterprise business intelligence and AI transformation planning
