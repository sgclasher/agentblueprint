# Agent Blueprint & Business AI Advisory Platform

**🤖 AI Assistant Context:** This is a comprehensive business AI advisory platform built with Next.js, featuring ServiceNow agentic AI flow visualization, interactive AI transformation timelines, and client profile management with structured business intelligence framework. The platform serves as a sophisticated business intelligence tool combining technical visualization capabilities with comprehensive data collection and strategic planning tools. Core technologies: Next.js 14, React 18, ReactFlow, Zustand, Dagre, Supabase. Design inspired by ai-2027.com with modern dark themes and floating UI elements.

**🎯 Current State:** Production-ready platform with **a comprehensive admin interface for external service credential management** and **a production-grade security architecture**. Features a **centralized, provider-agnostic `aiService`** (with implementations for OpenAI and Anthropic Claude) and **intelligent database-backed timeline caching**. The platform's credential management system is built to support multiple AI providers and CRM systems. **✅ Complete Admin Interface**: Users can securely add, test, and manage credentials for multiple services through a professional admin dashboard at `/admin`. **✅ Production Security**: Application-level authentication with JWT verification, user-scoped data access, AES-256-GCM credential encryption, and service role database operations following industry best practices. **✅ Timeline Intelligence**: AI-generated timelines are now highly specific and relevant, thanks to advanced prompt engineering that leverages the full context of client profiles. Database-backed caching provides 80-90% cost reduction with instant loading for repeated requests. **Client profiles are exclusively stored in Supabase** with complete user authentication and data isolation. **Enhanced UX Features**: The timeline view is now robust, with fixes for all known rendering and scrolling bugs. The platform features **consistent professional theming** and a polished user experience. **✅ Code Health**: Recent refactoring has improved code consistency, removed component duplication, and fixed bugs related to caching and API authentication, resulting in a more stable and maintainable codebase. Architecture includes robust service layers, secure multi-user authentication, and production-ready credential management. **Ready for the next phase of development** to enable UI-based provider selection for timeline generation.

**🚀 Next Steps:** 
1. **Implement Frontend UI for Provider Selection**: Add a user interface to the timeline generation view that allows users to select their preferred AI provider from the ones they've configured in the admin dashboard.
2. **Add PDF Export Capabilities**: Implement a feature to export the generated AI timelines as professional PDF documents for easy sharing and presentation.
3. **Expand Enterprise Connectors**: Integrate with other enterprise systems beyond ServiceNow, such as Salesforce or HubSpot, to broaden the platform's data visualization and business intelligence capabilities.
