## Troubleshooting

### Google Gemini Model Name Errors

If you encounter a 404 error when generating a timeline with Google Gemini (e.g., `models/gemini-2.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent`), this means the model name in your provider configuration is not valid for the current Gemini API. Google frequently updates model names and requires exact matches.

**Solution:**
- Edit your Gemini provider in the admin UI and set the model name to a valid value, such as `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, or `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`.
- Always check the [official Gemini API model list](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) for the latest valid names.
- Save and test the connection before using timeline generation.

See `instructions.md` for a detailed troubleshooting guide.

### **Admin UI and Provider Selection**
- The admin dashboard now supports robust credential management for all AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc.).
- Provider selection is fully dynamic and works as long as the selected provider is configured and uses a valid model name.
- If you encounter errors, always check your provider configuration and refer to the troubleshooting section above.
